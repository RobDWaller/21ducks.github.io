<h2>What is the 50:50 draw?</h2>
<p>The 50:50 draw is a membership scheme whereby each member purchases a ticket for a small fee each month. Each 
member will be allocated their own unique number for each ticket they purchase.</p>
<p>A draw will be made every month, with the owner of the drawn number winning the prize!</p>
<h2>What can I win?</h2>

<p>1st Prize: <strong>£100</strong></p>
<p>2nd Prize: <strong>£25</strong></p>
<p>However, the size of the prize is dictated by how many people join the draw.</p>
<p>Under the rules for the Draw, the Supporters Trust are commited to pay out 50% of the income in prizes. Amounts 
payable will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as membership levels vary.</p>
<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
