Thank you to everyone who took part in our recent member and former member surveys. Your voice has helped shape the future of the Aylesbury United Supporters' Trust (21CD). We’ve listened carefully, and now we’re excited to show you how we’ve turned feedback into action.

## 💬 YOU SAID...
* 🏟 You value updates on the Club’s return to Aylesbury.
> 77% of current members told us that regular updates on the Club’s return to Aylesbury are your top concern. This wasn’t just another item on the list: it was the most important priority across the entire survey.
* 💬 You want better communication and more visibility into committee decisions.
* 🎉 You’d love more fan engagement – from social events to youth memberships.
* 🌐 You’d like stronger online platforms and access to decision-makers.

## 🚀 WE DID…
* ✨ Launched a New-Look 21CD Membership.
> We're refreshing how you experience your membership with improved benefits and a stronger sense of community. We have also launched a Duck Club (free).
* 🥇 Welcomed the Gold Club into 21CD.
> One united space for hardcore supporters with premium perks and easier access to everything 21CD has to offer.
* 📢 Revamped Communication & Visibility.
>We've launched a dedicated 21CD website (https://21ducks.co.uk) and a [21CD X (formerly Twitter) account](https://x.com/21DucksTrust) to bring fans together and share updates in real time. We’re also committing to regular transparency reports from the committee.
* 🏠 Committed to keeping you updated on the club’s journey home.
> We've heard loud and clear that returning to Aylesbury is your top priority. That’s why we’re putting regular updates front and centre through newsletters, online posts and trust-led communications.
* 📜 Published a New Constitution.
> A clear, modern and member-driven constitution, aligning with the values and future vision of Aylesbury United.
* 💻 Built Our Own Online Fan Forum – 21st Century Ducks on Discord!
> Welcome to the 21st Century Ducks Fans Forum, the brand-new online hub for all things Aylesbury United. This isn’t just another message board – it’s a modern, interactive space where conversations happen in real time, from matchday chat to club history, local football gossip to supporter initiatives.
* Why Discord?
> Discord gives us flexibility to build a thriving, real-time community where conversations feel personal and engaging. Respect and trust come first – we’re encouraging fans to use real names (or familiar supporter names) to keep the community welcoming and inclusive.
* How to Join:
> Membership of the forum is open to 21CD and Gold Club members. Simply complete the online [Google Form](/members/forum.html) to register your interest, and we’ll send you a personal invite.
> **This is just the beginning.** As more supporters join, we’ll shape the forum together – from topic suggestions to live match chats, fan-led campaigns and more.

* 🤝 Planning Member Experiences & Touchpoints.
> From online conversations to in-person gatherings, we’re creating more opportunities to connect – with details shared as plans unfold.
