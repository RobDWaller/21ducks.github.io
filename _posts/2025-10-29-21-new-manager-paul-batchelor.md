Following Aylesbury United's [announcement](https://aylesbury.football/news/chairmans-update) earlier this week, we are writing to update our members on changes within the club’s leadership and coaching structure.

## The Return of 'Batch'

We are absolutely thrilled to welcome back Paul Batchelor as our new First Team Manager!

"Batch" will be a familiar name to many Ducks fans. He was part of previous coaching set-ups here at AUFC, and even when he managed elsewhere, he never truly left the Ducks family. Many of you know him well from coaching members' children as part of the Mini Ducks set-up on Saturday mornings and through his commitment to local football coaching.

Paul recently coached local rivals Aylesbury Vale Dynamos. His tenure there was marked by a strong emphasis on youth development and integrating talented young local players into the first team, a philosophy we are excited to see him bring to the Ducks.

He is joined by his new coaching team: former Ducks striker Danny Gray and Matt Kelloway.

- Danny Gray is a well-known figure, having been a former Ducks striker and a respected coach in the local football scene.
- Matt Kelloway is a talented coach who was also part of Paul Batchelor's set-up at Aylesbury Vale Dynamos, where he managed their successful U23 team.
Paul’s vision, particularly with his BASE Academy, aligns with our club's future direction. He will play a significant role in developing the entire club, and we look forward to the energy and experience he and his team bring to the First Team.

Despite recent off-field challenges and transitions within the club, we ask all members and supporters to unite and rally strongly behind Paul Batchelor and his team as we focus on the future development and success of Aylesbury United.

## A New Role for Dave Tuttle

Dave Tuttle has stepped down from his role as First Team Manager. However, Dave will remain part of AUFC in the new capacity of Club Development Officer. In this position, he will support training needs across all sections of the club and lead a fantastic initiative to connect with our community by offering free after-school training sessions at local schools.

We extend our sincere thanks to Dave and his dedicated coaching team, Hamzah Collins, Ahmed El-Amir, and James Gibbs, for their hard work over the past 18 months.
