We begin this communication by sincerely acknowledging Graham Read's significant commitment to Aylesbury United Football Club over the last two decades. We recognise and thank him for his efforts and for being there for the club in its most challenging times, particularly when its very existence was threatened. His long-term support has been vital to the club’s continuity.
 
It is therefore with considerable regret that we report that a Vote of No Confidence in Mr Read, in his capacity as Club Chairman and majority shareholder, was carried by an overwhelming majority of the membership of 21st Century Ducks (21CD) at the recent 21CD Annual General Meeting (AGM).
 
This decision was not taken lightly. It reflects a collective concern among members that certain actions by Mr Read have become incompatible with the long-term future and stability of Aylesbury United Football Club, and governance standards.
 
## Specific issues of concern include:
 
- **Trademark Registration:** Mr Read proceeded to register a trademark of the club’s emblem without prior consultation with, or authorisation from, the Board of shareholders. This has raised serious concerns regarding transparency and governance.
- **Treatment of Stakeholders:** We have observed several instances of communication and behaviour towards board members and stakeholders that have damaged working relationships and undermined effective collaboration required for the club to function effectively.
- **Restriction of Merchandise Sales:** 21CD has experienced obstruction in generating merchandise revenue – an essential income stream that supports the club’s activities – which have arisen from decisions made unilaterally by Mr Read.
- **Lack of Communication:** Regular and essential updates on club matters, both operational and strategic, have not been provided to key stakeholders in recent months.
- **Governance Concerns:** The cumulative impact of the above, along with ongoing concerns raised by sponsors and the recent spate of resignation of board members, has created an unhealthy environment and eroded stakeholder confidence.
- **Club Returning Home:** Despite repeated public commitments by Mr Read regarding a return to a home ground in Aylesbury, following the loss of Buckingham Road stadium in 2006, no detailed, actionable, and board approved plan has been forthcoming. This has led to widespread disillusionment regarding the fulfilment of this critical objective.
 
Taken together, the members of 21CD believe these issues raise fundamental concerns about Mr Read’s continued role as Club Chairman and majority shareholder. We believe that leadership and control must now pass to individuals or entities capable of restoring confidence, unity and a forward-looking vision for Aylesbury United FC.
 
We therefore respectfully call upon Mr Read to sell his shareholding and to facilitate the transfer of the club’s emblem trademark to Aylesbury United FC Limited. These steps would enable a renewed focus on the club’s core mission to return home and allow us all to work constructively towards a stronger future for the club.
