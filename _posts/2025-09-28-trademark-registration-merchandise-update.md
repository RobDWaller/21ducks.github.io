As many of you will know, Aylesbury United FC’s emblem was registered as a trademark in the personal name of the club chairman, Graham Read. From the outset, 21CD has been clear: the emblem should be owned by the club itself, Aylesbury United FC Ltd, so that it remains a true community asset. This is important to:

- Safeguard the club’s identity for future generations,
- Ensure transparency and accountability in its use,
- Avoid unnecessary commercial or legal restrictions on supporters, volunteers, and
the Trust.

## Recent Developments

In recent months, Graham Read placed restrictions on 21CD’s ability to sell club-branded
merchandise, requiring monthly reporting and imposing a 20% surcharge on sales. 21CD
were also warned of potential legal action if items were sold without permission or meeting
the conditions set.

After further discussion, we are pleased to confirm that these restrictions have now been
lifted. 21CD is once again able to sell Aylesbury United merchandise including replica shirts
without the reporting or surcharge requirements. Supporters’ are now able to purchase
items from our fantastic range of merchandise via the [online club shop](https://aylesburyunited.square.site/s/shop) and at the majority of
home match days.

**This is a positive step forward, but it must be stressed: 21CD remains firmly of the view
that the emblem should belong to the club itself, not to an individual. This belief will
continue to guide our work and discussions.**

21CD will keep pressing for the emblem ownership to be transferred to the club, as we
strongly believe this is the right and sustainable solution for the future.

## Why This Matters

For years, proceeds from Supporters’ Trust merchandise have gone directly back into
supporting the club funding matchday operations and supporting wider community
initiatives. Being able to sell merchandise again is vital to ensuring we can continue this
support.

At the same time, these recent events underline why 21CD exists: to represent supporters,
to safeguard the club’s heritage, and to ensure the future of Aylesbury United is shaped by
its fans.
