Weâ€™re proud to announce the launch of the newly updated 21st Century Ducks (21Ducks) [Constitution](/assets/documents/21CD_Constitution_2025.pdf), a vital step in strengthening our democratic foundations and supporting the future of Aylesbury United Football Club.

The revised Constitution sets out the purpose, powers and rules of the Supportersâ€™ Trust, reflecting both our long-standing commitment to the Club and the evolving needs of our members and community. It includes clear structures for membership, general meetings, committee governance, financial transparency and how we support the Club both practically and financially.

## Whatâ€™s New?

This version brings our governance in line with current legislation under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, while also modernising the way we operate. It introduces:

* Greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of the Management Committee
* Updated procedures for financial accountability and audits
* Revised rules for supporter representation
* A formal process for requests for Club funding, to ensure transparency and fairness
* Strengthened provisions around community benefit and sustainability.

We believe this updated Constitution will better serve you, our members and the wider community by placing supporter voices at the heart of everything we do.

## We Want Your Feedback

Before the Constitution is formally ratified at our upcoming AGM, we are inviting all members to read the full document and share their feedback. This is your Trust, and your input is essential.

Letâ€™s continue to shape the future of 21CD together - for the fans, by the fans!
