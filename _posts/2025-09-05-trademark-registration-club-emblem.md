It has come to our attention that Aylesbury United FC’s emblem has been registered as a trademark in club chairman and majority shareholder Graham Read’s personal name, without any prior consultation or prior disclosure to the Club Board or Shareholders, including 21st Century Ducks (21CD), Aylesbury United Supporters’ Trust.
 
This raises important questions about how the emblem should be held to best protect the club’s long-term interests. 21CD firmly believe this registration should have been made in the club’s name, Aylesbury United FC Ltd, to safeguard the emblem as a community asset. This is vital to:

* Ensure transparency and accountability in its use;
* Prevent future commercial or legal restrictions on supporters, volunteers, or the Trust;
* Preserve the identity of Aylesbury United for current and future fans.
 
21CD raised this issue with Graham Read, and over the previous few months have requested that he transfer the ownership of the trademark into the club’s name. To date these requests have not been agreed to.
 
Following our objection, we were advised by Graham Read that 21CD could no longer sell merchandise featuring Aylesbury United FC branding without extensive monthly reporting to him as the trademark owner and paying a surcharge to the club. This surcharge would be in addition to 21CD’s considerable monthly donation to the club. 21CD were advised that legal action could follow if sales were made without permission.
 
As a direct result, 21CD will no longer be able to produce or sell any club merchandise.
 
This outcome is particularly regrettable given that all proceeds from Supporters’ Trust merchandise sales have historically been reinvested into supporting the football club including contributions toward matchday costs, fundraising efforts, and wider community initiatives. This will also have an impact on 21CD’s income and ability to support the club financially.
 
We remain committed to finding constructive solutions and representing supporters’ views and the best interests of the football club. We will continue to monitor developments closely and will update as more information becomes available.
 
This moment however is also an opportunity – a turning point. By building a stronger Supporters’ Trust, we can create the foundations for a better future and give supporters a voice. This is our chance to protect what matters most, to reaffirm that the club belongs to all of us, and to lay the groundwork for a club that is stronger, fairer, and truly representative of its supporters.
