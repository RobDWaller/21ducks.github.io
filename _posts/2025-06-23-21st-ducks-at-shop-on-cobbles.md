On Sunday, June 22nd, 2025, the Aylesbury United Supporters Trust, 21st Century Ducks, had a fantastic day at the Aylesbury Town Council's [Shop on the Cobbles](https://www.aylesburytowncouncil.gov.uk/council_events/shop-on-the-cobbles/) event!

Committee members Andy Martin (Chairman) and Rob Waller were on hand, setting up our marquee to showcase and sell official club merchandise. We also ran a popular Duck Hunt competition, giving attendees the chance to win a cuddly duck and a football.

The event was a brilliant opportunity for us to raise the club's profile right here in the heart of Aylesbury and connect with local businesses. We're thrilled to say we raised money for Aylesbury United and enjoyed giving out free stickers to plenty of children!

It was a truly successful day, strengthening our ties with the community and generating support for the club. Up the Ducks!
