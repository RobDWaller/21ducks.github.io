    <h2>Chairman: Andy Martin</h2>
    <img src="/assets/img/committee/andymartin.jpeg" alt="default profile picture" />
    <p>Andy Martin is chairman of 21 Ducks the Aylesbury United Supporters' Trust and is our main representative on 
    the Aylesbury United club board. Andy has supported the club ever since he saw The Ducks beat Oxford City 4-1 at 
    his first ever match in late 1997, he was hooked from that first game. Part of the attraction was the passionate 
    fans and their ability to make some noise. As a result he can often be heard singing and shouting in the terraces! 
    Andy works for NHS England as a Programme Manager and brings a wealth of experience in managing teams and organsing 
    initiatives, which he uses to help our Trust and Club move forward. He is determined to help our community club 
    return home! #BringTheDucksHome Andy once scored a goal for Aylesbury United Supporters Team (The Chicken Run) and 
    this was announced over the tannoy at The Ducks game that afternoon although the goal was accredited to 'Andy 
    Marshall'. Hopefully you won't hear him repeat similar mistakes over the tannoy given he is the man behind the 
    microphone at every home game.</p>

    <p>Mike has been a loyal supporter of Aylesbury United since moving to the town in 1995. From 2015 until 2025, he 
    served as the club's official match photographer, capturing countless memories before retiring from the role. He 
    remains closely involved, currently working on a detailed history of the club covering the years 1897 to 1955 due 
    for publication later this year. A former journalist, writer and corporate communications specialist, Mike retired 
    in 2013. He continues to put his experience to good use as a Trustee of the Cancer Care and Haematology Fund, 
    supporting vital treatment services within the Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. Passionate about the future 
    of Aylesbury United, Mike is committed to helping the club finally return home to the town. In the early 1970s, 
    Mike used to race and rally cars - until the money ran out!</p>
