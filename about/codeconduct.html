<h2>Let's Keep Aylesbury United FC a Club We Can All Be Proud Of</h2>
<p>As supporters, we all want to see the team do well. But being part of Aylesbury United isn't just about results, 
it's about how we carry ourselves as a fanbase and what we stand for.</p>
<p>That's why we're sharing a quick reminder about the AUFC Code of Conduct. It sets the standard for behaviour 
across the club, including players, coaches, officials and supporters.</p>
<p>üìù <a href="https://myclubpro.blob.core.windows.net/images/FileUploads/1003/167538/AUFC%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20%E2%80%93%C2%A0November%202024.pdf" target="_blank">

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>We all get passionate on matchdays. That's what makes football what it is. But there's a line and it's 
important we stay on the right side of it. As 21st Century Ducks, we want to support the team in a way that reflects 
the values of the club and the community behind it.</p>
<p>The Code is about creating a safe, respectful environment for everyone involved, whether that's on the pitch, in 
the dugout or in the stands.</p>
<p><strong>For Supporters:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Back the team positively - home or away</li>
    <li>Keep it respectful towards officials, opposition players and fans</li>
    <li>Don't tolerate discrimination, abuse or aggression - call it out if you see it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Everyone:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Act with integrity and fairness</li>
    <li>Respect the decisions of match officials</li>
    <li>Represent the club in a way that does it justice</li>
</ul>
<h2>This Is Our Club Too</h2>
<p>We're proud of Aylesbury United and proud to stand behind the team. But how we show our support matters. The 
atmosphere we create has a real impact on the players, the staff and everyone watching.</p>
<p>So let's keep the standards high. Let's be loud, be united and be the kind of supporters others want to stand 
alongside.</p>
