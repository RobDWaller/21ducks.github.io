This now annual event will take place on Saturday 22nd November 2025 to coincide with a "home" fixture this season. As usual it will see a group of hardy Ducks fans, and anyone else who'd like to join, walk the distance from Aylesbury to the match itself, in Chesham of course, a distance of approximately 15 (mostly scenic!) miles.

Our chosen fundraising partner this season is Youth Concern, and proceeds from the walk will benefit this important local charity. 

This season's walk is particularly poignant, marking the 20th full season playing out of the town. Following recent well documented troubles off the pitch, the event will be an opportunity to come together in a positive way to demonstrate the vital role the club still plays in the community, despite the men's team having played out of the town for so long.

As a bonus, the game should see Jack Wood, our Captain, recognised for breaking Aylesbury United's all time appearance record, a truly incredible achievement!! 

Please join us at 8 am at Youth Concern, Whitehill Lane, Aylesbury, HP19 8FL for an 8:30 am departure. This will be a leisurely walk at a manageable pace suited to most so we hope to see as many people as possible on the day!
